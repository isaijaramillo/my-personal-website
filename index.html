      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A couple of things about me: my name is Isai, pronounced (ee-sa-ee), and I'm 20 years old. I'm a pet father of 2 doggies, 2 snakes, 2 guinea pigs, and 1 cat. My girlfriend is now ready for another cat!
        I joined the Illinois Army National Guard at age 17 because I wanted to try something new and exciting. Graduating Basic Training and AIT is my greatest accomplishment, knowing that I'm in the 1% Club. Now I'm ready to start my career learning as a Software Engineer at <strong>Flatiron</strong>!</p>

      <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I have a couple of interests. I love building things with my hands. When I was 15, I built my first PC for gaming, and I also constructed a stand for my 50-gallon fish tank at that time. My recent build is a snake terrarium that I made for my 1-year-old corn snake.
        Additionally, I enjoy going on hikes and runs whenever I can. Photography is another hobby I'm trying to get better at.
